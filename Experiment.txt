Describe your experimental setup and your results.

There are three potential attack policies Attack_Weakest, Attack_Most_Dangerous, and Attack_Closest.
Using a bash loop the program will be runn 100 times for each possible attack policy matchup (6 matchups).

The results of each run will be printed to a text file in order to review the win rates of the policy matchups.

The matchups are the following:

1. Attack_Most_Dangerous against Attack_Most_Dangerous

2. Attack_Most_Dangerous against Attack_Closest

3. Attack_Most_Dangerous against Attack_Weakest

4. Attack_Closest against Attack_Closest

5. Attack_Closest against Attack_Weakest

6. Attack_Weakest against Attack_Weakest

Results:

1. The results for most dangerous vs most dangerous were as expected fairly evenly distributed between Red and Blue teams. Out of 100 runs however there were no ties.

2. The team with the most dangerous policy dominated the team with the closest policy with the most dangerous policy winning 100 out of 100 trials.

3. The most dangerous policy in this test also held a heavy advantage over the attack weakest policy. Again the team with attack most dangerous policy won 100 out of 100 matches.
